Harnessing the power of AI and big data, we used information on refugees to predict where in the United States they could go for the highest chance of not only getting accepted through the immigration procedure, but also in finding success in terms of careers and education. 

The API that powers the prediction is located at the repository linked below:
https://github.com/Leschonander/HackNYFlaskAPI
Used Scikit-Learn and Flask to deploy the API into production.
